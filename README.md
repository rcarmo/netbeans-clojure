# Clojure Plug-in for NetBeans 7.4

Forked from [@GeertjanWielenga](https://github.com/GeertjanWielenga)'s [original work](https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/leiningen_clojure_and_netbeans_ide).

## Note:

This is currently broken on NetBeans 8.0, and I haven't yet had time to investigate why. Pull requests are welcome.

## Roadmap

In no particular order:

* Code completion (local symbols only)
* lein deps
* Add preferences support (for lein path, classpath, etc.)
* Check build output 
* Check syntax highlighting for .cljs files
* REPL window (lein repl)
* Namespace navigation
* Code completion (project symbols and Java fields/methods)
* Support lein-ancient
* Clojars support (browse and add libraries, editing project.clj)
* Testing and debugging options
* More templates
* lein trampoline
